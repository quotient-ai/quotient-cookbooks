This repository contains cookbooks and examples demonstrating how to monitor and evaluate AI systems for hallucinations, retrieval quality, and other reliability issues using [Quotient AI](https://www.quotientai.co/).

## What You Can Do

- **Build and Monitor AI Agents**: Track LangChain agents in real-time
- **Evaluate Search Quality**: Automatically detect when AI search results contain unsupported claims
- **Improve AI Reliability**: Get insights into common failure patterns and how to fix them
- **Production Monitoring**: Set up automated monitoring for your AI applications

## Getting Started
Visit [app.quotientai.co](https://app.quotientai.co), sign up for a free account, and grab an API key from Settings. **Quotient is completely free to get started!** Check out the [pricing page](https://www.quotientai.co/pricing) for details on free tier limits and paid plans.
