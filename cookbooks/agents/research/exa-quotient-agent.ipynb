      "➡️ Final answer: Based on the information retrieved, I couldn't find a specific initiative that introduced reusable digital workflows for archaeology in 2025. However, I can provide some relevant information about recent developments in digital archaeology that are close to what you're asking about:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AutArch: While not specifically mentioned as a 2025 initiative, AutArch is described as a scalable system that can serve the growing field of digital humanities in archaeology. It's designed to be applicable to any material and can grow with increasing demands. This represents an important step forward in applying artificial intelligence to archaeological research.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Storytelling in Archaeological Data Production: There's a mention of a research project focusing on challenging \"archaeonormativity\" through storytelling. While this isn't explicitly about reusable digital workflows, it does represent an innovative approach to archaeological data production and interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Innovation in Archaeological Methods and Practice: A source discusses the heterogeneity of global archaeological methodology and the need for innovation in methods and practice. It mentions the potential of new initiatives to affect archaeological interpretation and create different conditions for practitioners and communities to experience archaeology more richly, safely, and justly.\n",
      "\n",
      "These developments suggest that there is ongoing work in the field of digital archaeology to create more efficient, scalable, and innovative methods for data collection and interpretation. However, I couldn't find information about a specific initiative in 2025 that introduced reusable digital workflows for archaeology.\n",

      "\n",
      "David Richardson was named acting administrator of FEMA on Thursday, May 8, 2025. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the key details:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. David Richardson is a former Marine Corps officer who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Africa.\n",
      "2. Prior to this appointment, he was serving as the Department of Homeland Security's assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction.\n",
      "3. It's noted that he does not appear to have any experience in managing natural disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also mentions that Richardson's appointment came after the previous administrator, Cameron Hamilton, was ousted. During Hamilton's last appearance before a House Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday (presumably May 7, 2025), he had shared concerns about how FEMA assistance is administered.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that this appointment is for an acting role, which typically means it's a temporary position until a permanent administrator is nominated and confirmed.\n",

      "It's worth noting that this information comes from a third-party website, and while it appears to be current for 2025, it's always a good idea to verify such information directly with Apple for the most accurate and up-to-date pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other sources I retrieved don't provide specific pricing information for 2025, but they do confirm the existence of the Family Plan and mention that it allows multiple users to access Apple Music under one subscription.\n",
