    "\n",
    "- `ChatOpenAI` initializes the OpenAI model (`gpt-4o`) as the core reasoning engine.\n",
    "- `TavilySearch` allows the agent to perform real-time web searches.\n",
    "- `TavilyExtract` lets the agent extract structured content from search results.\n",
    "- `ChatPromptTemplate` defines how the agent should behave. We provide:\n",
    "  - A `system` instruction that frames the task as a research assistant\n",
    "  - A placeholder for user messages (`messages`)\n",
    "  - An `agent_scratchpad` where the agent stores and reasons through its tool calls\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is constructed using `create_openai_tools_agent`, which automatically maps available tools to OpenAI's function-calling format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we wrap the agent with `AgentExecutor`, enabling it to execute multi-step reasoning. By setting `return_intermediate_steps=True`, we get full visibility into how the agent calls tools — essential for logging and evaluation later on.\n"

Solar and energy storage are leading the charge.\\n*   Artificial intelligence’s (AI) insatiable energy demand is reshaping the grid, pushing for rapid deployment of clean and reliable energy sources while advanced nuclear builds momentum for the future.\\n*   From industrial policies to a nuclear renaissance, here are 4 key trends that will shape the future of clean energy.\\n\\nThe year 2024 saw an impressive acceleration of investment in clean energy solutions despite the increased cost of financing and geopolitical headwinds. The year was the first of many in which investment in solar photovoltaic ($500 billion) surpassed all other generation sources.\\n\\n[Investment](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2024/overview-and-key-findings) in battery storage grew by more than 20% and exceeded $50 billion. The sectors involved in clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels announced projects and offtakes while advanced nuclear regained momentum.\\n\\n[![Image 67: Global investment in clean energy and fossil fuels, 2015-2024](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/rPR0w8mZ6qXHKdLnEH2aeOVkpiYOqDiOyfI_yOzlQow.png)](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/global-investment-in-clean-energy-and-fossil-fuels-2015-2024)\\n\\nGlobal investment in clean energy and fossil fuels, 2015-2024 Image: International Energy Agency\\n\\nRapid cost reduction drove much of the growth, making project economics increasingly attractive. Of all the emerging technologies, energy storage has made great strides. The [cost](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/the-role-of-energy-storage-technologies-in-the-energy-transition/) of lithium-ion batteries has dropped more than 90% over the last decade, and in 2024 alone, it fell 40%.\\n\\nAt the same time, the rise in clean energy spending is also underpinned by strategic elements: major economies are deploying new industrial strategies to spur clean energy manufacturing and establish stronger market positions.\\n\\nThese shifts set a very dynamic context for 2025. Here are our top four things to watch.\\n\\n**1. Industrial policy takes centre stage**\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nConnections between energy, trade and manufacturing are deepening. The new emerging energy economy presents major opportunities for countries looking to manufacture clean technologies, their components and related materials.\\n\\nIncreasingly, governments and populations value things such as jobs, manufacturing, energy security and cost; they prioritize these over emissions reduction.\\n\\nIn 2025, governments will further shape energy transition policies to support their industrial and economic ambitions.\\n\\nWe will see broader, more integrated policies targeting jobs, investment and advanced energy investments’ broader economic impact.\\n\\n**2. AI hunger for energy**\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThe computational power needed to sustain AI’s growth [doubles roughly every 100 days](https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/icomputing.0006), driving an exponential increase in the number of data centres required globally and associated energy use.\\n\\nAI and data centres will thus become a key driver for electricity demand growth.\\n\\nIt is not just about volume but also timing and location. Data centres need a reliable, stable power supply around the clock, challenging the industry’s emissions reduction goals. Hence, there will be a race to find and acquire data centre sites with abundant, clean, and reliable energy supplies at scale.\\n\\nIn the big tech industry, the last 12 months have seen increasing investment in advanced nuclear solutions, from small modular reactors to fusion. However, these promising options will only be able to deliver energy in the 2030s.\\n\\nDriven by immediate needs, the industry in 2025 will also be increasingly deploying currently available solutions, such as storage, clean hydrogen and wind and solar.\\n\\n##### Have you read?\\n\\n*   ##### [Europe\\'s clean energy future can only be delivered through unified action](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/10/europe-green-energy-future-unity-wef-draghi//)\\n\\n*   ##### [How to finance battery energy storage and ensure constant clean energy](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/05/how-to-finance-battery-energy-storage-clean-energy//)\\n\\n*   ##### [Why regulatory hurdles need to be overcome for clean energy expansion](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/03/regulatory-hurdles-clean-energy-transition//)\\n\\n**3. A tipping point for nuclear energy**\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nIn the past one to two years, attitudes toward nuclear energy have significantly shifted. Today, at a societal level, many activists agree with pragmatists that nuclear energy is an integral part of the energy transition.\\n\\nEnergy needs are growing fast in the economy, driven by AI, population, and economic growth. At the technological level, small modular reactors and fusion present advanced options. This has created momentum, and many people are talking about nuclear renaissance.\\n\\nHowever, so many pieces need to fall into place, from skills to regulations to financing and the industry often still faces many of its old challenges. In 2025, we will see government and industry action to accelerate the nuclear renaissance in “old” nuclear countries, such as France and the United States and new entrants, including Poland.\\n\\n**4. Continued focus on R&D and innovation**\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe clean energy sector has been continuously innovating and will accelerate further in 2025.\\n\\nThis is reflected in increasing investment and public budget allocations for research and development in energy, which aims to improve technical parameters and efficiencies, drive costs down, mature emerging technologies, and invent future technologies.\\n\\nMature technologies such as solar photovoltaic and wind turbines have gone through this journey over previous decades. Emerging technologies such as batteries, electrolyzers and carbon management solutions are experiencing their own innovation paths, although with even greater urgency and growth rates.\\n\\nAccept our marketing cookies to access this content.\\n\\nThese cookies are currently disabled in your browser.\\n\\nAccept cookies\\n\\n**Advanced energy solutions**\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThe World Economic Forum supports an integrated approach to energy solutions, including energy storage, advanced nuclear, clean fuels, hydrogen, and carbon removal. No single technology will solve the energy transition alone; a mix of solutions will be needed.\\n\\nDifferent regions, industries and companies will have their strategies but they must work together.\\n\\nPlatforms, such as the Forum’s [Advanced Energy Solutions community](https://www.weforum.org/communities/advanced-energy-solutions-community/), can help speed up this cooperation and accelerate the deployment of new technologies, such as energy storage, clean fuels, hydrogen, advanced nuclear and carbon removal, from decades to years.\\n\\nThe community engages industry leaders who drive frontier segments of the energy system to shape the advanced energy solutions industry vision and narrative. It supports partnerships among innovators, large energy companies, energy users and investors and informs policymaking.\\n\\n##### Don\\'t miss any update on this topic\\n\\nCreate a free account and access your personalized content collection with our latest publications and analyses.\\n\\n[Sign up for free](https://www.weforum.org/join-us/individuals)\\n\\nLicense and Republishing\\n\\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\\n\\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\\n\\n##### Share:\\n\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fstories%2F2025%2F01%2F4-key-trends-to-watch-in-clean-energy-technology-in-2025%2F)\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=wef&text=4%20key%20trends%20to%20watch%20in%20clean%20energy%20technology%20in%202025%C2%A0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fstories%2F2025%2F01%2F4-key-trends-to-watch-in-clean-energy-technology-in-2025%2F)\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fstories%2F2025%2F01%2F4-key-trends-to-watch-in-clean-energy-technology-in-2025%2F)\\n*   [](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=4%20key%20trends%20to%20watch%20in%20clean%20energy%20technology%20in%202025%C2%A0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fstories%2F2025%2F01%2F4-key-trends-to-watch-in-clean-energy-technology-in-2025%2F)\\n*   [](whatsapp://send?text=4%20key%20trends%20to%20watch%20in%20clean%20energy%20technology%20in%202025%C2%A0+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fstories%2F2025%2F01%2F4-key-trends-to-watch-in-clean-energy-technology-in-2025%2F)\\n\\n![Image 68: World Economic Forum logo](https://www.weforum.org/a-weekly-logo.svg)\\n\\nForum Stories newsletter\\n------------------------\\n\\nBringing you weekly curated insights and analysis on the global issues that matter.\\n\\n[Subscribe today](https://pub.s6.exacttarget.com/u1toxyddesm)\\n\\n### More on Energy Transition\\n\\n[See all](https://www.weforum.org/stories/energy-transition/)\\n\\n[![Image 69](https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/o3sDfg7O8BYX0CCTNnWBd-xuY3-q_E0ahsPw9ZbC5VI.JPG)](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/record-energy-investment-and-more-top-energy-stories/)\\n\\n[Energy investment on track for record $3.3 trillion,and more top energy stories](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/record-energy-investment-and-more-top-energy-stories/)\\n\\nRoberto Bocca\\n\\nJune 6, 2025\\n\\n[![Image 70](https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/XXjryN5K-1920.jpg) ![Image 71](https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/XXjryN5K-1920.jpg) 1:53](https://www.weforum.org/videos/clean-energy-china/)\\n\\n[Clean energy just led to a historic fall in China\\'s emissions](https://www.weforum.org/videos/clean-energy-china/)\\n\\n[![Image 72](https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/hx1Zm2bZ-1920.jpg) 2:01](https://www.weforum.org/videos/solarduck-launches-floating-solar-farms-at-sea/)\\n\\n[SolarDuck\\'s floating solar farms bring clean power to the sea](https://www.weforum.org/videos/solarduck-launches-floating-solar-farms-at-sea/)\\n\\n[![Image 73](https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/xpYkzGRIy6Wa4cPR5tBUUDYTWk8wUT8ikv3eBuIVEWo.JPG)](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/autonomous-vehicles-technology-future/)\\n\\n[Which countries are ahead in the global autonomous vehicle race?](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/autonomous-vehicles-technology-future/)\\n\\nForum Stories\\n\\nMay 30, 2025\\n\\n[![Image 74](https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/wuJc29so-1920.jpg) 3:47](https://www.weforum.org/videos/cars-plastic-waste/)\\n\\n[Old cars are full of plastic waste.
