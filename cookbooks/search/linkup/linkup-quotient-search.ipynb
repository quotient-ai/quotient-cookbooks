            "\n",
            "1. **Automated Evaluation Models**:  \n",
            "   - Vision-language models (VLMs) and language models (LMs) are used to autonomously evaluate agent trajectories and performance by reasoning over textual and visual data (e.g., screenshots).  \n",
            "   - Two main variants are used: a modular caption-then-reason approach and an end-to-end approach with advanced VLMs like GPT-4V. These methods achieve high agreement (74.4% to 92.9%) with oracle evaluation metrics on benchmarks such as WebArena and Android-in-the-Wild (AitW).  \n",
            "   - These evaluators can also serve as discriminators to refine agent policies autonomously through techniques like inference-time policy refinement and filtered behavior cloning.\n",

            "   - Methods like DigiRL train agents directly in-the-wild using autonomous RL, with online and offline phases, improving success rates significantly over prior methods.  \n",
            "   - These agents are evaluated on real device emulators and physical devices, demonstrating improved performance in diverse tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Safety and Risk Monitoring**:  \n",

            "\n",
            "5. **Simulation and Large-Scale Testing Platforms**:  \n",
            "   - Companies like Coval use large-scale simulation platforms to identify issues and improve agent reliability before deployment, drawing parallels to testing in autonomous vehicles.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Continuous and Integrated Evaluation**:  \n",
            "   - Evaluation is integrated throughout the agent lifecycle, from development to deployment, including unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, as well as ongoing monitoring in live environments to ensure robustness and alignment.\n",
