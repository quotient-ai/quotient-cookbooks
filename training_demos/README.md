The training underscore demos folder holds all of the demos that John Berryman will be interacting with each folder contains a very similar structure there's going to be a main.py file which can be run to kick off a simulation that takes hundreds of prompts and generates data. The actual simulation is in the demo folder. folder. There's also a scripts folder. and you can look there to see what all you can do inside this demo but likely Basically the main thing is to generate prompts that serve as fodder for running a massive simulation. There is also a training folder which is going to have all of the code necessary to pull down content and train this stuff.

All the demos use independent UV setups. so they have their own pyproject.toml, so do the normal uv sync and then run the main.py. The README in the individual demos will have further info about that demo.
